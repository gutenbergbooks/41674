of those moments of lyrical ecstasy of which Corot experienced
so many, and which, by his genius, those less fortunate are enabled
to share. The &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; in the drawing and painting of the trees is
reminiscent of some words spoken by the painter when Paris was
oppressing him&mdash;&ldquo;I need living boughs. I want to see how the
leaves of the willow grow from their branches. I am going to the
country. When I bury my nose in a hazel-bush, I shall be fifteen

<p>The work of Jean Baptiste Camille
Corot has been steadily rising in the
estimation of the instructed ever since he
won his first notable successes in 1840.
During the greater part of the artist&rsquo;s life-time
the rise was very gradual, and he
would have been astonished indeed if he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>could have known how rapid it was to be
after his death. It is by no means only a
rise in the selling prices of such of his
works as come into the market&mdash;a Corot
has something more than a collector&rsquo;s value;
but figures are in their way eloquent, and
when we find a work (&ldquo;Le Lac de Garde&rdquo;)
for which the painter was glad to get 800
francs selling for 231,000 francs within thirty
years of his death, the rapid growth in the
fame of the painter is materially evidenced.</p>

<p>There are fashions in art as in everything
else: for reasons which the dealers
could often disclose if they would, this or
that artist&rsquo;s work is suddenly boomed, and
for a time commands absurdly big prices
in the auction rooms, only to find its proper
level again when it is no longer to anybody&rsquo;s
interest to maintain an artificial
valuation. But it is difficult to believe that
the passing of years will do anything to
diminish the fame of Corot, or lessen the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
prices which connoisseurs are willing to pay
for the possession of his work. Rather will
both increase, there is reason to think, as
under the winnowing of Time&rsquo;s wings the
chaff is separated from the grain, and many
a painter hailed as a master to-day is
scorned if not forgotten. For whatever may
happen, it is impossible to believe that
the work of Corot will ever become old-fashioned.
There is in it something that
does not belong to one time, but to all
times; not to one place, but to all places.
It is elemental and universal, and instinct
with a vitality and youth that unnumbered
to-morrows can have no power to destroy.</p>

<p>Even those critics who most strongly
opposed the canons Corot professed&mdash;and
there were many of them&mdash;were often unable
to condemn a heresy in which faith was so
justified by works: coming to curse, like
Balaam, they remained to bless. A far more
trying ordeal the artist had to undergo in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the intemperate rhapsodies of enthusiastic
admirers. But neither censure or praise,
the scepticism of his own people, or the
indifference of the picture-buying public,
could tempt him to deviate from the path
that for him was the right one. &ldquo;Vive la
conscience, vive la simplicit&eacute;!&rdquo; he used to
say. His creed was in the words, and he
lived up to it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;">
<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE II.&mdash;L&rsquo;ETANG.</span>

<p>&ldquo;Beauty in art is truth bathed in the impression, the emotion that
is received from nature.... Seek truth and exactitude, but with
the envelope of sentiment which you felt at first. If you have been
sincere in your emotion you will be able to pass it on to others.&rdquo;
So said Corot to a pupil, and &ldquo;L&rsquo;Etang&rdquo; would in itself be sufficient
to prove that he knew how to practise what he preached. It is a
variant on a simple motive that he was never weary of, and that he
knew how to invest with new beauties every time it came to him.</p>
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE II.&mdash;L&rsquo;ETANG." title="" />
</div>

<p>He claimed for the artist an entire independence.
&ldquo;You must interpret nature
with entire simplicity, and according to
your personal sentiment, altogether detaching
yourself from what you know of the
old masters or of contemporaries. Only in
this way will you do work of real feeling.
I know gifted people who will not avail
themselves of their power. Such people
seem to me like a billiard-player, whose
adversary is constantly giving him good
openings, but who makes no use of them.
I think that if I were playing with that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
man, I would say, &lsquo;Very well, then, I will
give you no more.&rsquo; If I were to sit in
judgment, I would punish the miserable
creatures who squander their natural gifts,
and I would turn their hearts to cork.&rdquo;
Again he says&mdash;&ldquo;Follow your convictions.
It is better not to exist than to be the
echo of other painters. As the wise man
says, if one follows, one is behind.&rdquo; And
again&mdash;&ldquo;Art should be an individual expression
of the verities, an ardour that
concedes nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is on the face of it rather a hopeless
task to attempt to trace the artistic pedigree
of a painter who, at all costs, will be individual
with &ldquo;an ardour that concedes nothing&rdquo;;
and it would not help much towards an
understanding of him. At the same time, it
would be a mistake to suppose that Corot
was quite so independent of the influences
around as, perhaps, he imagined himself to
be. &ldquo;Artists,&rdquo; says Shelley in a notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
utterance, &ldquo;cannot escape from subjection
to a common influence which arises out of
an infinite combination of circumstances belonging
to the times in which they live,
though each is in a degree the author of
the very influence by which his being is
thus pervaded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus Corot took his part in the revolt
against classicism in France, with which the
name of the little village of Barbizon is so
inseparably associated. He coloured it, and
was coloured by it&mdash;so much was inevitable;
but his intense individuality none the less
preserved him in an aloofness from what I
may be permitted to call the broad path of
the movement. And as he grew older, so
far from becoming more affected by his contemporaries,
he only seemed more and more
to discover himself.</p>

<p>Before all things Corot was an idealist&mdash;a
painter of ideas rather than of actualities;
which, of course, does not in any way dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>count
his simple sincerity. His landscapes
give the idea of a place or an effect rather
than its exterior appearance. The rendering
of a beautiful passage of colour, of a gracious
form, or a delicate play of light and shade,
was never held to be sufficient. Within
the body of phenomena he saw the throbbing
heart and luminous soul of Nature
revealed; and it was the very heart and
soul of his subject that he strove to
prison in his pigments. At the same time,
dreamer as he was, there was always in
him a healthiness and sanity rare indeed
amongst those who are given to seeing
visions.</p>

<p>I remember a studio gathering at which
Corot was discussed. I wish the master,
who always loved to be praised by those
who could understand and were sincere,
could have heard what was said of him. At
length some one said, &ldquo;Corot was a great
artist. It is true that he also happened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
be a great painter.&rdquo; The words seemed to
me to have meanings.</p>

<p>A painter is a man who does something;
an artist one who is something. The statement
may not be new, but it is true; and
what it involves is, I think, too often forgotten.</p>

<p>In considering what a painter has done
it is natural enough to be preoccupied with
his method, to become immersed in an
analysis of his technique. There will be an
attempt to determine whether he is faithfully
obedient to the accepted canons, or
modifying and adapting, if not it may be
defying them. In the latter case an endeavour
must be made to find a solution for
the question whether these progressive or
revolutionary activities are justified in their
result.</p>

<p>It is criticism of this sort that fills innumerable
studios with a jargon unintelligible
to all but those who are, so to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
say, &ldquo;in the trade&rdquo; in one way or another,
and can speak with a craftsman knowledge&mdash;of
technical terms if of nothing
else. Such talk is often futile enough,
a breaking of butterfly nothings upon a
ponderous wheel of words; though it can,
on occasion, be useful enough. In any
case only a few, comparatively speaking,
are likely to be either interested or benefited.</p>

<p>It is altogether another matter when an
artist is approached. How he conveys his
message is of much less importance than
what is conveyed. He may be poet, painter,
or musician, but the need for understanding
what he does is infinitely less than that
of learning what he is. This is not to say
that, in the case of the artist, technique is
beneath consideration; but it is to say that
it must not be considered first. Trembling
script sometimes give the authentic gospel
its birth in words, and a true vision may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
be recorded by an uncertain hand. To
lose sight of the artist in contemplating
the technique of the work by which he
reveals himself is to sacrifice the substance
for the shadow.</p>

<p>Corot was a great artist. To him his
art was not a trade or an amusement, still
less a trick, but a religion. He worshipped
with an unceasing diligence and intensity
before the chosen altar of his adoration.
Less than his best he dared not offer there.
Nothing that was not wholly honest and
true could be acceptable. What a magnificent
character he gives to himself, all unconsciously,
in confessing to M. Chardin
an artistic sin! &ldquo;One day I allowed myself
to do something chic; I did some
ornamental thing, letting my brush wander
at will. When it was done I was seized
with remorse; I could not close my eyes
all night. As soon as it was day, I ran to
my canvas, and furiously scratched out all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the work of the previous evening. As my
flourishes disappeared, I felt my conscience
grow calmer, and once the sacrifice was
accomplished I breathed freely, for I felt
myself rehabilitated in my own sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What would some of our painters say
to a conscience so tyrannous?</p>

<p>It is, for me, impossible to look at
Corot&rsquo;s work without feeling that his was,
if I may put it so, a monastic nature.
Here is a serene and cloistered art, something
secluded from the traffic of the
everyday world, a vision intense rather than
wide. I think of Corot as a priest at the
altar of one of Nature&rsquo;s innermost sanctuaries
celebrating sacramental mysteries.
Every picture that came from him is an
elevation of the Host.</p>

<p>This is the quality in his work, much
more than a fastidious refinement nearer
the surface, that gives it so high a distinction.
Hung in a gallery among other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pictures, a Corot does not clamour for
notice. It is much too quiet in matter and
manner for that; but, after awhile, it draws
the eye, and when it has done so its hold
is secure. The surrounding canvases almost
invariably begin to look a little vulgar in
its neighbourhood. And this not only because
rioting colour might well look blatant
by the side of the tender greys and greens
and rose flushes that the artist loved so
well, but because the spirituality of which
those tones are merely the expression places
the Corot upon another and a higher plane.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE III.&mdash;LES CHAUMI&Egrave;RES</span>

<p>Luminous and almost uncannily true in tone, &ldquo;Les Chaumi&egrave;res&rdquo;
takes high rank among the finest productions of Corot&rsquo;s maturer years.
It is the work of a man who &ldquo;knows,&rdquo; who is able to take hold of
essentials, and let non-essentials go, with a certainty of discrimination.
Profound knowledge, so thoroughly assimilated as to be
instinctive in its application, can alone account for both the completeness
and simplicity of the landscape, the result achieved with
apparently so absolute a lack of effort.</p>

<p>To come upon a Corot in a gallery is
like stepping out of the noisy glare of the
market-place into the cool stillness of a
church. Market-places are good things,
and the noisy crowd is perhaps only noisy
because it is doing its appointed work in
a right hearty fashion; but the Presence
seems nearer in the silence of the church.
The silence is not dead, but quick with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
soundless speech. So with a Corot picture;
its quietness is the very antipodes of stagnation.
It seems to spread far beyond the
limits of the frame in ever-widening waves,
until everything around is subdued.</p>

<p>The only other works of art which have
ever given me quite the same impression
in this direction are one or two of those
dreaming Buddhas that, wherever they may
be, seem to be shrined in a stillness emanating
from themselves.</p>

<p>From first to last Corot was as independent
as he was industrious. He strove
always to see Nature with his own eyes,
and to keep his vision clear and simple.
Whether or not other painters had a
grander or nobler vision was nothing to
him. It mattered only that he should be
true to the grace that was his own. &ldquo;I
pray God every day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that He
will keep me a child; that is to say, that
He will enable me to see and draw with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
the eye of a child.&rdquo; That prayer was surely
answered, for never did an artist look out
upon the world with a more direct simplicity,
or with eyes more delicately sensitive
to the appeal of beauty.</p>

<p>It was seldom the obviously picturesque
that appealed to him. He seemed instantly
to apprehend the most elusive of the
beauties in the scene before him. That
death-bed utterance of Daubigny is significant:
&ldquo;Adieu; I go above to see if friend
Corot has found me new landscapes to
paint.&rdquo; That was it: Corot never failed to
find new landscapes to paint, for his eye
was keen enough to pierce through what
seemed commonplace, and discover the
underlying beauty. Starting off on one
of his innumerable sketching excursions, he
remarks to a friend that he has heard bad
accounts from painters of the country for
which he is bound, but adds that he has no
doubt he will find pictures there. And, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
course, he found them. The pictures are
always there, though the faculty of seeing
them is rare.</p>

<p>No one ever worked more constantly and
faithfully from Nature, or became more
intimately acquainted with the subtle outward
expressions of her innermost moods;
but the profound knowledge thus gained
was only treated as the poet treats a wide
vocabulary; as a means of expression, not
as in itself worth exploitation. The scene
before him was not recorded as a collection
of facts, but as it had stirred his emotions,
and as it was, in a sense, transformed by
his vivid imagination. The resulting picture
is the record of an adventure of the soul;
the outward reality is not lost, but rather
realised in a strange intensity. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said
Corot, pointing to one of his landscapes,
&ldquo;see the shepherdess leaning against the
trunk of that tree. See, she turns suddenly.
She hears a field-mouse stirring in the grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of how the artist went to work when he
had &ldquo;found&rdquo; a new landscape some notion
may be gained from M. Silvestre&rsquo;s description.
&ldquo;If Corot sees two clouds that at
first sight appear to be equally dark, he
will, before building up the whole harmony
of his picture on one or other of them, apply
himself to discover the difference he knows
must exist. Then, when he has decided on
the darkest as well as the lightest tone in
the scene before him, the intermediate
values readily take their places, and subdivide
themselves indefinitely before his discerning
eyes. These values, from the most
positive to the most vague, call to one
another and give answer, like echo and
voice. When the artist sees he can divide
the principal values of the landscape before
him into four, he does so by numbering the
different parts of his rough sketch from 1 to
4, 4 standing for the darkest and 1 for the
lightest patch, while the intermediate tones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
are represented by 2 and 3. This method
enables Corot, with the help of any old
pencil and any scrap of paper, to make
records of the most transitory effects seen
upon a journey. Corot was not a man to
make an inventory of his sentiments, and
the fact that he made such records proves
that they were sufficient for his own purposes.
As a rule he first of all puts in his
sky, then the more important masses in the
middle of the composition, then those to
the left and to the right; he then picks out
the forms of the reflections in the water, if
there is water, and so establishes the planes
of his picture, his masses falling in one
behind the other while one watches him.
Sometimes he proceeds in a less orderly
way; for it goes without saying that his
methods are the methods of freedom, and
not the invariable recipes of a pedant. He
runs an unquiet eye over every part of the
canvas before putting a touch in place, sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
that it does no violence to the general
effect. If he makes haste he may become
clumsy and rough, leaving here and there
inequalities of impasto. These he afterwards
removes with a razor, as if he were
shaving his landscape, and leaving himself
free to profit by such accidents of surface
as are happy in effect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture of Corot sketching in shorthand
shows him when the long and close
study of Nature had enabled him to generalise
with confidence, and when a memory, always
retentive, had been trained to a pitch that
made it far more reliable than any sketchbook
memoranda. Although he always
expressed impatience with the idea that
anything worth doing could be done merely
by taking pains, Corot was the least apt
of men to spare any pains that were essential
to his purpose; and nothing could be
farther from the truth than the suggestion
sometimes made, that he was wanting in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
this respect. To generalise as he generalised
is not to be careless of detail, but the very
reverse: it implies a knowledge so complete
of every element in a landscape that those
belonging to a particular view of it can be
selected with an unerring judgment, and
what is non-essential eliminated. &ldquo;Put in
as much as you like at first, and afterwards
efface the superfluity,&rdquo; is a bit of advice
that comes from Corot himself. It was not
a strikingly original remark, but it could
not have been made by other than a conscientious
worker.</p>

<p>It is certainly a mistake to suppose that
Corot was careless of details in the sense
that he did not give them due consideration;
but he always realised that details
were details after all. &ldquo;I never hurry to
the details of a picture,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;its
masses and general character interest me
before anything else. When those are well
established, I search out the subtleties of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
form and colour. Incessantly and without
system I return to any and every part of
my canvas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is a note in Mr. George Moore&rsquo;s
<i>Modern Painting</i> that seems to throw
some illumination upon Corot&rsquo;s manner of
looking at his subject. Mr. Moore came
upon the artist, an old man then, &ldquo;in front
of his easel in a pleasant glade. After admiring
his work, I ventured to say: &lsquo;What
you are doing is lovely, but I cannot
find your composition in the landscape
before us.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;My foreground is
a long way ahead.&rsquo; And sure enough,
nearly two hundred yards away, his picture
rose out of the dimness of the dell,
stretching a little beyond the vista into the
meadow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think Corot&rsquo;s foreground had a habit
of being a considerable way ahead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80%;">
<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE IV.&mdash;LE SOIR</span>

<p>&ldquo;My &lsquo;Soir,&rsquo; I love it, I love it! It is so firm,&rdquo; said Corot, standing
before his picture in the exhibition gallery in company with an
appreciative friend. It is &ldquo;firm&rdquo; enough beyond question, and the
sky especially is a marvel of delicate, palpitating colour. But it is
much more, a moment of magic beauty, evanescent as the reflected
picture on a bubble-bell, seized and made permanent; an emotion of
pleasure cast into a material shape.</p>
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE IV.&mdash;LE SOIR" title="" />
</div>

<p>To most, Corot is &ldquo;the man of greys,&rdquo;
the painter of the twilight. Without for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
moment suggesting that this is true in so
far as it seems to hint that his art had
very narrow limitations, I am certainly inclined
to believe that the general eye has
fixed itself upon his most characteristic and
most valuable work. The two dawns, as
the old Egyptians called them, Isis and
Nephthys, the dawn of day and the dawn
of night, revealed themselves to Corot
with a fulness to be measured only perhaps
in part by the manner in which he
has revealed them to us. The stillness,
the freshness, the indescribable tremor of
awakening life, the curious sense of a remoteness
in familiar things, the expectancy
as of some momentous revelation, all that
goes to make the mystery and magic of
the dawn, he knew how to translate into
subtle yet easily understandable terms of
form, and tone, and colour. It was a miracle
to which he seemed to have found the key&mdash;perhaps
by means of that prayer to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
&ldquo;kept a child.&rdquo; Over and over again he
invoked the dawn to appear upon his
canvas, and never in vain. In ever-varying
robes of loveliness, but the same in all of
them, the dawn responded to his call.</p>

<p>Grey dawn! The words had a cold and
gloomy sound until Corot interpreted them,
taking the gloom away and leaving of the
cold only the delicious shiver of the morning
freshness. Beautiful almost as the
dawn itself&mdash;born of it as they were&mdash;are
those wonderful pearly greys of his. His
palette seemed to hold an infinite range
of them, each pure and perfect in itself,
and each in a true harmonic relation to
the others.</p>

<p>And if the painted dawns are beautiful,
they are also true; they carry instant
conviction of their absolute verity. There is
only one thing that can make a painted
canvas do this, and that is truth of tone,
and of tone-values Corot made himself a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
master, mainly because he never ceased to
be a student. He retained the eye of a
child, but his mind became stored with the
accumulated experience of many long hours
that were only not laborious because the
work was a delight. And great as the
store grew in process of time, he was adding
to it up to the last.</p>

<p>Here is a picture by Albert Wolff of the
artist at the age of 79, when the hand of
Death was already stretched out towards
him. &ldquo;An old man, come to the completion
of a long life, clothed in a blouse, sheltered
under a parasol, his white hair aureoled in
reflections, attentive as a scholar, trying to
surprise some secret of nature that had
escaped him for seventy years, smiling at the
chatter of the birds, and every now and again
throwing them the bar of a song, as happy
to live and enjoy the poetry of the fields
as he had been at twenty. Old as he was,
this great artist still hoped to be learning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is altogether an important thing about
Corot that he was always singing&mdash;in season
and out of season I was about to say, when
I remembered that he would probably have
declared that it was always singing-time.
He went to his work carolling like a lark,
though with a somewhat robuster organ,
and snatches of song punctuated his brush
strokes. The day&rsquo;s work done, he broke
out into melody in earnest, and sang to
himself, to his friends, at home or abroad,
with equal vigour and enjoyment. We are
told that on one occasion his irrepressible
song broke out at an official reception,
doubtless to the confusion of dignities and
the shocking of many most respectable
people.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85%;">

<span class="caption">PLATE V.&mdash;PAYSAGE</span>

<p>The play of light filtering through foliage has never been more
beautifully rendered upon canvas, or with a closer approximation to
the truth of Nature, than in the &ldquo;Paysage,&rdquo; reproduced here. The
manner in which the tree has been portrayed, the body and soul of
it, is not less astonishing. The landscape is a masterpiece among
masterpieces, and an impressive witness to Corot&rsquo;s amazingly sensitive
faculty of apprehending what was in front of him, both with eye
and mind.</p>
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE V.&mdash;PAYSAGE" title="" />
</div>

<p>I cannot but think that something of
music found its way into Corot&rsquo;s pictures.
They look as if they could have been done
in music as well as they were done in paint.
In a way they were: if there was always a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
song on his lips, surely there was also a
song at his heart. One may say that his
paintings were built to music like the walls
of Thebes. They are haunted by sweet
harmonies, and seem charged with hidden
melodies that tremble on the verge of
sound.</p>

<p>Many of those who read may shake their
heads at this attempt to make a confusion
of two arts, but my apology shall take the
form of a quotation from Corot himself.
Moved to sudden emotion by a magnificent
view, he exclaimed, &ldquo;What harmony!
What grandeur! It is like Gluck!&rdquo; I
think the man who said that may possibly
have painted a little music, without caring
for a moment whether he was confusing
the arts or not. Perhaps he felt that
painting and music were more nearly
related than a certain school of critics can
allow itself to admit. But that is by the
way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>When in Paris he was frequent in his
attendances at concerts and the opera, and
indeed music always drew him with a power
only second to that of his chosen mistress&mdash;painting.
As the twig is bent the tree will
grow&mdash;it may be that had the accidents of
his early environment been other than they
were, his name would be famous as that of
a great composer instead of a great painter.
Fortunately we do not know what we may
have missed, while we are fully conscious
of what we have gained.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The father of Corot the painter was
Louis Jacques Corot, who, if he escaped
being altogether a hairdresser, only did so
by a narrow margin. One would rather like
to imagine him as another &ldquo;Carrousel, the
barber of Meridian Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Such was his art, he could with ease<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Curl wit into the dullest face;</span><br />
Or to a goddess of old Greece<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lend a new wonder and a grace.</span><br />
The curling irons in his hand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Almost grew quick enough to speak;</span><br />
The razor was a magic wand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That understood the softest cheek.&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Such was Carrousel, according to Aubrey
Beardsley&rsquo;s ballad, and such Louis Jacques
Corot should surely have been, if only to
make his son more easily explainable; but,
as a matter of fact, he appears at an early
age to have forsaken the high art of hairdressing
for more strictly commercial pursuits.
He became a clerk, and his wife&rsquo;s
assistant manager.</p>

<p>For Madame Corot was a business
woman&mdash;very much so. She was a native
of Switzerland, and evidently of the practical
nature that so often distinguishes the Swiss
people. A woman of property in a moderate
way, and two years older than her
husband, as well as a capable manager, she
does not appear by any means to have
allowed marriage to submerge her own per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>sonality.
As a <i>marchande de modes</i> she
was a distinct success. Fashion found its
way to her establishment in the Rue du Bac,
and the name Corot became a hall-mark
of elegance.</p>

<p>Perhaps her son owed more to his
mother than has sometimes been suspected.
Corot himself remarked that a skill equal
to that of the painter was often shown by
the costumier in the blending of colours&mdash;indeed
he went farther, and said as much
of a certain flower-seller of his acquaintance
and her bouquet-making. Really, when one
comes to think of it, he may be said to
come of artists on both sides, for if his
father was scarcely as much of a hairdresser
as we should like him to be, his
paternal grandfather&rsquo;s claim to the description
is beyond criticism.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is a little
sad that, when he had completed his
educational career without winning any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
considerable distinction, it was decided to
make a draper of him. There is every
evidence that, in so far as the attempt went,
he made a very bad draper indeed. I do
not know how long it took him to come to
the conclusion that he would never make
a good one&mdash;not very long, I should say&mdash;but
after a trial of six years or so, it would
seem that his father had arrived at the
same conclusion. When his son declared
his intention of abandoning drapery and
of becoming a painter, Corot <i>p&egrave;re</i> did not
offer any strenuous objection. He thought
that the young man was a fool, and said
so, with possibly a little bitterness, but on
the whole with resignation. What was
more to the point, he made a small provision,
so that his son might live while
&ldquo;amusing himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The provision in question was certainly
a small one&mdash;1500 francs a year&mdash;but it
prevented Corot from ever knowing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
extremities of poverty to which some of
his brilliant contemporaries were reduced.
As he said, he could always count on &ldquo;shoes
and soup&rdquo;&mdash;and shoes and soup, if not
much in themselves, can often bridge the
gulf that lies between hope, or even content,
and despair. Moreover, Corot&rsquo;s wants were
few. Throughout his life he had the simplest
tastes, and his only extravagance was
a charity that gave without measure and
never thought about return.</p>

<p>However, figure to yourself Corot fully
embarked on his career as a painter. He
is, roughly, twenty-five years of age, and for
stock-in-trade has glowing health, a certain
familiarity with pencil and brush already
acquired, an unquenchable enthusiasm, and
so many francs a year. On the whole it
is the outfit of a very happy and fortunate
young man.</p>

<p>Once emancipated from the compulsions
of drapery he lost no time in setting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
work. He went straight to Nature, and
even at this time produced work that bore
a hall-mark as distinctive as that of his
later years. He worked also in the studios
of Michallon and of Bertin, and if they did
him no good (and there is little reason to
suppose such a thing), they at least did
him no harm. Already he was too keenly
engaged upon a line of his own.</p>

<p>Around Ville d&rsquo;Avray, where his father
had bought a house, he found numberless
subjects ready to his hand, subjects of
which nothing that he saw in his wide
wanderings could ever make him tired. He
also had an experience in Morvan. I shall
venture to quote from Mr. Everard Meynell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Corot and his Friends,&rdquo; concerning it. &ldquo;He
went, presently, to the little hamlet of
Morvan, whose blacksmith gave him hospitality.
As a member of a farrier&rsquo;s numerous
family, with the forge for sitting-room, and
its fires to assuage the cold of mortals and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
of metals, and soup for fuel, and the blue
smock of the country for raiment, Corot
saved money. He saved money out of the
1200 francs of his allowance; even the cost
of canvas and paints did not bring his expenditure
to three francs a day. His
austerity meant Rome, but it was not a
hard road for him to follow. Never was a
man less provoked to any of the pampered
ways of living.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85%;">
<a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE VI.&mdash;LE VALLON</span>

<p>&ldquo;Le Vallon&rdquo; is probably one of the best-known and most universally
admired of Corot&rsquo;s works. It does not record one of those
tender twilight effects in which, as may be believed, the painter found
his keenest pleasure, but the quiet glory of a golden afternoon. The
simple landscape is bathed in the most wonderful of painted sunshine,
and possesses an extraordinary verity. The material essentials
of the scene are set down with an unerring regard for truth, but it is
in interpreting its &ldquo;sentiment&rdquo; that the most notable success has
been achieved.</p>
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE VI.&mdash;LE VALLON" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;It was in Morvan that Corot picked up
with the peasant, and found in him many
things fit to be learned. He learnt about
soups, and pipes, and blouses, and the habit
of the sunrise; and nothing that he learned
did he forget. Soups, and pipes, and blouses,
and the sunrise lasted him till the end of
his life. These things, like the honest
humour and good-comradeship of a man
afield, were in his blood; but Morvan and
Morvan&rsquo;s blacksmith, and daily things done
with the Morvan peasantry, developed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
peasant in the painter. Corot&rsquo;s was nearer
to the peasant&rsquo;s character than Millet&rsquo;s
even; for the emotional gloom of Millet&rsquo;s
outlook, his sense of the price paid for life,
his sense of death and toil, of the significance
of the seed and the scythe, made
him a person too great and dreadful to be
familiar with those for whom he thought
and felt. Corot&rsquo;s laugh and song, his raillery
and content, were things to be friends
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think that in the foregoing passage
the influence upon Corot of the Morvan
visit, though it may well have been a
memorable one, has been perhaps a trifle
exaggerated. Surely he must have &ldquo;picked
up&rdquo; with the peasant long before, and found
out how much he had in common with the
dweller on the soil. And will the comparison
with Millet fully bear examination? I doubt
it. The extraordinary delicacy and refinement
of Corot&rsquo;s vision is at least a thing as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
foreign to the peasant as the tense
emotionalism of Millet; and I suspect that
the deep-rooted content of the one was as
much removed as the implicit revolt of the
other from the people with whom in their
several ways they were both so much in
sympathy. That in personal relations Corot
got nearer than Millet to his peasant
friends is more than probable. If not more
understandable in reality, he seemed so in
daily intercourse with those as simple and
direct as himself. There was nothing in
him to repel. His gay and expansive
nature invited a confidence that was seldom
withheld, except by those too distrustful
and secretive themselves to understand it.</p>

<p>The first visit to Italy, undertaken in 1825,
marks an epoch in the life of Corot, as in
that of many another painter. But though
it widened his outlook, and taught him
much that otherwise he might never have
learned, it did not tempt him to any de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>viation
from the simple principles that all
through his life guided him in the practice
of his art. All the inducements which Italy
could offer were not sufficient to make
him incline to use other eyes than his
own when painting. He seems to have
treated the Masters in an unusually cavalier
manner. Nature in Italy interested him
much more than Art in Italy: he was more
concerned with sunsets than with Michael
Angelo.</p>

<p>As was his custom, Corot was always at
work in Italy, &ldquo;sitting down&rdquo; with his
usual happy knack in finding the right spot,
and painting what he saw as he saw it,
with careful fidelity to his own beautiful
way of looking at things. Sometimes he
worked from models in his room, but whether
indoors or out, day after day found him painting,
painting with unabated enthusiasm and
ever-fresh delight.</p>

<p>And he made friends, as always&mdash;among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
them d&rsquo;Aligny, who was the first to take the
true measure of the then somewhat awkward
young man. &ldquo;D&rsquo;Aligny,&rdquo; says Mr. Everard
Meynell, &ldquo;was the discoverer of his genius
and its advertiser; for having found Corot
at work on the &lsquo;Vue du Colis&eacute;e,&rsquo; now hanging
in the Louvre, he made a formal statement
of his admiration at &lsquo;Il Lepre&rsquo; (a caf&eacute;
in Rome much frequented by painters) that
night. &lsquo;Corot, who sings songs to you, and
to whom you listen or call out your ribald
chaff,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;might be master of you all!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friendship lasted until the death of
d&rsquo;Aligny in 1874, and Corot never forgot
the generous praise that had so encouraged
him during those early days in Rome.</p>

<p>In 1827 Corot exhibited for the first time
in the Salon. The two pictures which bore
his name were not unnoticed, but no one
was sufficiently interested to purchase them.
It was indeed fortunate on the whole that
he was assured of &ldquo;shoes and soup&rdquo; from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
other sources than his art, for it was not
until 1840 that it brought him any monetary
reward worth mentioning. But it would be
beside the mark to say that he had to endure
any remarkable period of neglect. It
must be remembered that his career as a
painter did not seriously begin until he
was of an age when many artists have
already secured something of a position for
themselves. His work, too, was not of such
a description as to make any sensational
impact upon the attention of the art-loving
public.</p>

<p>Before he returned from his first visit
to Rome he had, however, made his mark
in some measure, had been hailed by a few
discerning critics as one of the elect. The
enthusiastic testimony of d&rsquo;Aligny and one
or two others had been endorsed with signatures
that carried some weight&mdash;only at
home was he still held to be an amateur.
His right to a place among the more notable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
artists of his time was no more questioned,
except by those whom ignorance or prejudice
had rendered incapable of sane
judgment.</p>

<p>Once more, and again, he visited Italy,
painting as he went, and what was much
more to the purpose, filling with magic
pictures the tablets of his mind: but I
doubt if these subsequent visits carried him
far beyond the point he had arrived at
during the first. Each day he was gaining
more knowledge and greater dexterity, but
his point of view was never seriously modified.
Italy gave to his delicacy some of
its strength, invested the most tender-hearted
of painters with the touch of sternness
that could alone save his work from
becoming invertebrate: but it could not
materially alter his habit of vision, or turn
into dramatic shape an inherently lyrical
gift. He saw Nature as a song in France
first of all and last of all; Italy only helped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
him to give the song a more severe metrical
basis than it might otherwise have possessed.
Much that was sweet in Corot it
would seem that the relentless landscapes
and pitiless skies of Italy helped to make
strong.</p>

<p>From 1840 onwards one may say that
Corot was steadily growing into fame. In
that year two of his pictures were bought
by public authorities, and thus, for the first
time, an official imprimatur was set upon
his increasing reputation. He never knew
the feverish delight of awaking one morning
to find himself famous. The value of his
work was only very slowly recognised, and
as his paintings attracted more and more
notice a heavy fire of hostile criticism was
opened upon them: with no more effect
than to make him smile as he went upon
his way.</p>

<p>Some of these egregious criticisms are
so utterly beside the mark that it is difficult<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to believe them anything but the result of
a wilful misapprehension on the part of
the critics. They seem to be inspired by
venom and spite when read to-day: but in
their own time they probably fairly represented
the serious opinions of many who
thought they were defending legitimate art
against a spreading anarchy. It is even
possible that such as Nieuwerkerke, who,
as Mr. Meynell records, was &ldquo;overheard
describing Corot as a miserable creature
who smeared canvases with a sponge dipped
in mud,&rdquo; honestly believed that he was
administering a well-deserved castigation
to a charlatan. It is more than likely that
many of us are making mistakes almost as
serious to-day, so we need not find such an
attitude incredible.</p>

<span class="caption">PLATE VII.&mdash;SOUVENIR D&rsquo;ITALIE</span>

<p>Corot at the height of his powers is seen in the &ldquo;Souvenir d&rsquo;Italie.&rdquo;
The thousand subtle nuances of exquisite colour in the luminous
sky, the refined drawing and firm painting of the trees, and the
happy confidence revealed by every brush mark upon the canvas,
make it one of the most delightful and, we may say, most &ldquo;lovable&rdquo;
of its creator&rsquo;s works.</p>
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE VII.&mdash;SOUVENIR D&rsquo;ITALIE" title="" />
</div>

<p>There were other critics at this same
period who were less hampered by preconceived
notions, and came to a very different
conclusion than those who were able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
dismiss the whole Nature school with contempt
as &ldquo;pampered humbugs.&rdquo; Delacroix
could see that Corot was not &ldquo;only a man
of landscapes&rdquo; but &ldquo;a rare genius,&rdquo; and he
was not alone. Every year, as one masterpiece
after another appeared at the Salon
from the &ldquo;mud-dauber&rsquo;s&rdquo; brush, the general
body of artists and art-lovers were more
disposed to give him the rank that was
his due.</p>

<p>In 1848 Corot was elected one of the
judges for the annual exhibition by his
fellow-artists. He himself sent nine pictures,
and one of them, a &ldquo;Site d&rsquo;Italie,&rdquo; was
purchased by the State. The following
year Corot was again one of the judges,
and in 1850 he was elected a member of
the &ldquo;Jury de Peinture.&rdquo; He had become a
personage in the art-world of France.
Already in 1846 he had been decorated with
the Cross of the Legion of Honour, to the
astonishment of his worthy father, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
could not in the least understand on what
grounds such an honour had been done to
his failure of a son.</p>

<p>The history of Corot&rsquo;s following years
there is no necessity to follow in detail.
Like the years which had gone before, they
were fulfilled with happy labour. He
journeyed through the length and breadth
of France, to Switzerland, and elsewhere,
&ldquo;finding landscapes&rdquo; with that apprehensive
eye of his, and recording them on canvas
or on paper, or storing them in the pigeon-holes
of a memory that in such matters
never failed him. For the rest the record is
one of a continually increasing appreciation
of his work. It started in a very small
circle, extending thence in ever-widening
ripples. Almost imperceptibly his fame
increased until he became an acknowledged
master.</p>

<p>In view of the sums paid for many of
them since, the prices he obtained for his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
pictures seem ridiculously small, but there is
no reason to suppose that he was anything
but well content with such material rewards
as came his way. Indeed, so much to the
contrary, for some time he looked upon the
increasing prices which purchasers were
willing to pay with a mild astonishment
and a kind of humorous fear that it was
too good to be true.</p>

<p>The slighting of his earlier work and the
laudation excited by the later had precisely
the same effect upon him&mdash;that is none at
all. If one had asked him, I think he would
have said both alike were out of perspective.
And he would have spoken without any
taint of bitterness: for, from the very first,
he was both confident and humble.</p>

<p>Of the man Corot there are many portraits
both in pen and pencil, that help to
give an outward shape to the more intimate
revelation of personality to be found in his
work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most interesting is a portrait
by the artist of himself as a young man.
He is sitting, a burly, broad-shouldered
figure, before his easel. The face looks out
from the canvas square and strong, but the
full-lipped mouth is sensitive, almost tremulous,
and betrays the nature of the man
even more surely than the alert eyes;
though these eyes, on the pounce, one may
say, and the forehead drawn in the intense
endeavour to <i>see</i>&mdash;these also tell their own
story.</p>

<p>A pen-portrait of later date by Silvestre
describes the artist as &ldquo;of short but Herculean
build; his chest and shoulders are
solid as an iron chest; his large and powerful
hands could throw the ordinary strong
man out of the window. Attacked once,
when with Marilhat, by a band of peasants
of the Midi, he knocked down the most
energetic of them with a single blow, and
afterwards, gentle again and sorry, he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
&lsquo;It is astonishing; I did not know I was
so strong.&rsquo; He is very full-blooded, and
his face of a high colour. This, with the
bourgeois cut of his clothes and the plebeian
shape of his shoes, gives him at first sight
a look which disappears in a conversation
that is nearly always full of point, of wit,
and matter. He explains his principles with
great ease, and illustrates the method of
his art with anything at hand; and that
generally is his pipe. He so loves to talk
about his practices in painting that, a student
told me, he will talk in his shorts and with
bare feet for two hours at a stretch without
being once distracted by the cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many photographs are in existence to
present to us Corot in his autumn time.
Says M. Gustave Geffroy, examining one
of these: &ldquo;The features are clearly marked.
The brow, high and bare, crowned with hair
in the <i>coup de vent</i> style, is furrowed with
lines. His glance goes clear, keen, direct,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
from beneath the heavy eyelids. The nose,
short and fleshy, is attached to the cheeks
by two strongly marked creases. There is
a smile on the lips, of which the lower is
very thick&mdash;altogether a good, intelligent,
witty face.&rdquo; In general appearance, I may
add, these later portraits of Corot always
remind me of the late Mr. Lionel Brough.</p>

<p>To my mind there is something more
in these photographs than M. Geffroy has
called attention to. They are the portraits
of a very happy man. A deep spiritual happiness
and content make the old, wrinkled
face a beautiful one. It is the face of one
who, to use a lovely old phrase, &ldquo;walked
with God,&rdquo; and of whom it was said, &ldquo;<i>c&rsquo;est
le Saint Vincent de Paul de la peinture</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As one of his friends said, Corot was
&ldquo;adorably good.&rdquo; He was a good son, for
all that he found himself unable to fall in
with his father&rsquo;s desire to make him a successful
draper: and the fact that &ldquo;at home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>&rdquo;
his outstanding abilities were never recognised,
could not in the least abate the
warmth of his family affections. And he
was a good friend. He never forgot a
kindness done to him either in word or
deed, although his memory seemed to be
singularly incapable of retaining a record
of anything done to his hurt. It has been
said, and the argument could be powerfully
supported, that the same qualities that go
to the making of a good friend make a
bad enemy. Very likely it is true in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred: if so the case
of Corot was the hundredth. He seemed
to have a natural incapacity to bear malice
or retain a sense of injury. Perhaps he
was too simple or too wise; or, maybe,
both.</p>

<p>Not less characteristic of Corot than
his manner of going about always with a
song on his lips, was his incurable habit
of giving. The wonder is that he ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
had anything at all left for himself, that
even shoes and soup did not follow after
francs. And very reprehensibly, of course,
he gave to almost every one who had recourse
to him, as well as to many who did not. His
generosity was all but indiscriminate, and
conducted in a manner that, it may be
supposed, would drive a charity organisation
society to distraction. He was victimised
often and knew it, but the knowledge
never dulled the edge of an insatiable
appetite. To give was at once a luxury
and a necessity to him, as appears, and
he was never so gay as when he had been
indulging himself in this direction rather
more recklessly than usual. &ldquo;He would
paint&rdquo; (I quote from Meynell), &ldquo;saying to
himself, &lsquo;Now I am making twice what
I have just given.&rsquo; Or, again, having just
emptied his cash drawer, he would take
up his easel, saying: &lsquo;Now we will paint
great pictures. Now we will surprise the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
nations.&rsquo;&rdquo; Rather a foolish fellow evidently:
but &ldquo;one of God&rsquo;s fools,&rdquo; as I heard an
old priest say of a somewhat similar example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 85%;">
<a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>
<span class="caption">PLATE VIII.&mdash;VUE DU COLIS&Eacute;E</span>

<p>The &ldquo;Vue du Colis&eacute;e&rdquo; is a reminiscence of Corot&rsquo;s first visit to
Rome. It plainly shows that even in those early days he had
obtained a great mastery of his medium, and could set down with
distinction what he so clearly saw. Though the subject is a big one,
it is handled in such a fashion that simple dignity is its outstanding
characteristic. The &ldquo;Vue du Colis&eacute;e&rdquo; was one of the paintings that
first gained for Corot the high consideration of the more discerning
among his artist friends.</p>
<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="100%" alt="PLATE VIII.&mdash;VUE DU COLIS&Eacute;E" title="" />
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the love that made the
keynote of his character, all the investigations
of the curious have not discovered
an &ldquo;affair of the heart&rdquo; in Corot&rsquo;s life story.
It is a story to all intents and purposes
without a woman in it: or, if that is saying
too much, certainly without a heroine.
There has been some attempt to exalt his
relations with &ldquo;Mademoiselle Rose&rdquo; to
the level of a romance, but it has failed
completely for want of materials. Mademoiselle
Rose was one of his mother&rsquo;s
work girls, and in those early days, when
he was but newly emancipated from the
bondage of drapery, she used to come to
see him at his painter-work. She never
married, and thirty-five years later Corot
still counted her among his friends, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
she visited him from time to time. It is
a little romance of friendship, if you like,
it may have been on the part of Mademoiselle
Rose something more&mdash;who knows?&mdash;but
it cannot count as a Corot love-affair
on the evidence that is available.</p>

<p>As far as is known this is the nearest
approach to a &ldquo;love interest&rdquo; in the life of
the artist. It may have been that he
looked upon women too much with the
eye of an artist ever to be able to see
them merely as a man; more probably it
was the element of austerity in him that
kept him immune from passion.</p>

<p>With all his intense delight in life and
in living, Corot was always detached; always
preserved, as by a religious habit, from
actual contact with the world around him.
Through the midst of the follies, the extravagances,
and the vices of Romanticist
circles in Paris of the thirties, he passed
without coming to any harm, and character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>istically
enough, without losing his regard
for some of the wildest of a wild company.
He took part in much of the &ldquo;fun&rdquo; that
was going on, but though often in the set
he was never of it, and so far as can be
judged it did not influence him, or colour
his outlook upon life, in the slightest
degree.</p>

<p>I think it was this temperamental detachment,
and possibly a sense, unexpressed
even to himself, of being vowed to one particular
service, that prevented Corot from
ever &ldquo;falling in love,&rdquo; as the phrase goes.
Or, to put it another way, his life was so full
of his art, that there was no room within its
limits for another dominating interest.</p>

<p>Simple and single-minded, happily pursuing
the occupation that of all others he
would have chosen, he made his life a work
of art more lovely than the most beautiful
of his paintings. No one can live in such
a world as this for the allotted span and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
more without becoming acquainted with
grief, but Corot knew none of those searing
sorrows which scorch their way into
heart and brain, until they make existence
a burden hardly to be borne. His faith in
&ldquo;the good God,&rdquo; to whom he looked up with
so childlike a confidence, was so complete
that sorrow for him could hold no bitterness;
nor, deeply sympathetic as he was,
had it power over an impregnable content
and an unfailing serenity.</p>

<p>And he died as he had lived. A few
days before his death it is recorded &ldquo;that
he told one of his friends how in a dream
he had seen &lsquo;a landscape with a sky all
roses, and clouds all roses too. It was
delicious,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I can remember it quite
well. It will be an admirable thing to paint.&rsquo;
The morning of the day he died, the 22nd
of February, 1875, he said to the woman
servant who brought him some nourishment,
&lsquo;Le p&egrave;re Corot is lunching up there to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be hard to replace the artist;
the man can never be replaced,&rdquo; was one
fine tribute to his memory; and another,
&ldquo;Death might have had pity and paused
before cutting short so sweet a life-work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sale of some 600 of Corot&rsquo;s works took
place in the May and June following his
death. It realised nearly two million francs,
or &pound;80,000. This is, of course, not a fraction
of the sum that would be realised were the
same pictures to be put up to auction to-day;
but it shows that his achievement was
beginning to be estimated at something
approaching its true value.</p>

<p>Corot&rsquo;s work, of which at one time he
was able to boast he had a &ldquo;complete collection,&rdquo;
is now scattered to the four corners of
the earth. Paris possesses some splendid
examples at the Louvre, and there are many
not less admirable distributed among the
provincial galleries of France. America
holds a large number in public and private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
galleries, and there are in private ownership
in this country Corots sufficient to
make a magnificent collection. Lately the
National Gallery has been enriched, by the
Salting bequest, with seven fine paintings
from the master&rsquo;s hand, eloquent witnesses
alike to his individuality and variety.</p>

<p>To me it is an added joy, when I stand
before a Corot picture, to think of the
gracious personality of its creator. It is
almost as if his eager, happy voice were
pointing out the manifold beauties of the
miraculously bedaubed canvas, and recalling
the &ldquo;moment,&rdquo; so certainly made permanent
there.</p>

<p>It is always a &ldquo;moment&rdquo; that is seized
in Corot&rsquo;s paintings, with the exception of
some of the earliest. Nature is surprised
with her fairest charms unveiled, in a passing
emotion, of laughter or of tears. There
is life, movement, the tremble of being, in
everything set down. The air is palpitant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
with colour, rainbows are dissolved in an
atmosphere that clothes everything in magic
and mystery.</p>

<p>Beneath the gay confidence of the painting,
subserving the emotion of the moment,
what knowledge is shown in these pictures!
These tree forms, bold and delicate, with
such wonderful subtleties of drawing in
them, give more than externals. They
reveal a very psychology of trees, the soul
that the artist so plainly saw in everything
around him. He was concerned to set down
far more than the details of the scene before
him, not in the least satisfied to be but a
reporter. The higher, or, if you like, deeper
verities were what he strove for, and the
universal verdict to-day is that he did not
strive in vain.</p>

<p>The figure-painting of Corot is comparatively
little known, and it is a subject
of too much importance to attempt to deal
with adequately in small space. An en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>thusiastic
critic claims that it includes the
artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;absolute masterpieces,&rdquo; but I doubt
if many would agree, beautiful as some of
these figures are. They show the same
faculty of apprehending a sudden revelation
of beauty as is shown by the more familiar
landscapes, the same exquisite sense of
graces in form and colour, which elude the
eyes of most of us. But it is still in landscape
that Corot is supreme.</p>

<p>I have already stated my conviction that
he was not greatly influenced by other
artists, his predecessors, or contemporaries.
Perhaps Constable, to mention but one name,
helped to open his eyes, but once open he
used them as his own. Again, the classicism
which surrounded him in his youth left
gentle memories that in his age were never
quite forgotten; but it was worn as sometimes
an elderly gentleman wears a bunch
of seals, and had about as much to do with
the essential personality of the wearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>He was always true to himself. His
equipment was simple faith, definite purpose,
and unflagging zeal. A clear eye, a dream-haunted
brain, and a great loving heart&mdash;that
was Corot.</p>
